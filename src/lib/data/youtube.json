You might have heard of terms such as SPA, SSR, SSG, CSR, prerendering, or hydration but not quite sure what they are. Or maybe, you were wondering which one is the best strategy for the next big thing you are building. In this talk I will explain about each rendering strategy, and show how flexible SvelteKit is by mixing and matching them in the same app."

You need to deeply know about the i18n library and SvelteKit to not introduce bugs.\n\nInlang builds a solution right now, that makes i18n really simple to use.

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio. Today we have yet another guest with us to talk about Svelte. But first introductions. I'm Kevin, I run a site called Svelte school. And I'm heavily involved in the Svelte community in general. And I'm just a Svelte evangelist, I guess.\n\n\nAntony  0:20  \nI'm Antony, I'm the CTF Beyonk. And I'm also Svelte maintainer\n\n\nShawn  0:26  \nI work as a senior developer advocate at AWS, this is probably my last time in that role. And I'll have a new role coming up. Next time we do this recording, where hopefully, I think, if I'm not mistaken, I'll be working on a production Svelte project. So more needs to come hiding\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  0:46  \nideas. And our guest today is David Parker. He's a software developer, I guess. Maybe you can introduce yourself. Yeah,\n\n\nDavid Parker  0:58  \nI'm David Parker. I normally go by Parker, and I am CTO at Hobby DB for my day job where I do Angular, unfortunately. But I spend a lot of my free time doing Svelte and I run my site called listen addict calm, which we'll talk about a little bit later. And I'm making another project after that. So,\n\n\nAntony  1:19  \nso I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna point out here that that title developer, you know, with a guy who has two side projects, we should looking pretty decent. I'm going to say entrepreneur. It's a good title. I would like that.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  1:36  \nAll right, so before we get into the meat of the discussion, all, all are written sponsors, bots. So the first sponsors bought is actually not a sponsor, it's just some news about that. You can now support Svelte radio directly, so you'll get access to video versions of the podcast or you'll be able to listen to the episodes a couple of days early, even unedited, sometimes, so head on over to Svelte radio.com slash support, and you can read more about it there. Oh, and secondly, if you like the podcast, it would be awesome if you could leave a review on iTunes and subscribe. Alright, and that's it for the Yay, answers.\n\n\nShawn  2:24  \nI wish you I don't know. It's like, it's a great way to support independent radio, I guess. And this is this is kind of what we're doing.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  2:32  \nYeah. Yeah. It's it's like, yeah, it's easier than then hunting like sponsor, like real sponsors, I suppose. But I\n\n\nAntony  2:43  \nguess you know, after a while, they'll sort of just appear out of the woodwork really. So yeah, it's, but it's nice, I think I think being able to pay for something that has value, you know. And then having that sort of inside info, or the Sneak Peek is really, really valuable. So I think it's good. I think I like I like it.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  3:00  \nWe'll see how it goes. Do you run a Patreon as well? No. So I've actually looked at a couple of different solutions for this. And Patreon was one of them. But there's, there's like a lot of not being in the US and having to handle like VAT is a real hassle. patron does it for you, but the like the fees they take are ginormous. So I found some other some other ways to solve this. I'm think I'm currently going to use paddle. It's it's like a handle digital products and software. Pretty much I draw\n\n\nAntony  3:41  \nthe line, I draw the line that only fans I have a body for radio.\n\n\nDavid Parker  3:51  \nI have a comment. I don't think it's appropriate for this audience. So I'll hold my tongue.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  3:59  \nAlright, so so let's let's get into it. So so you're you said you were a an Angular developer, on your on your day job. So how did you end up doing doing Angular?\n\n\nDavid Parker  4:11  \nSo I'll just give you a super, super fast, short version of my history real quick. I was in the military in the United States, from 2000 to 2006, as a Java developer, so I basically sat in front of a computer an..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio. Today we have yet another guest surprise. We always have guests these days. But first, some introductions. So I'm Kevin, I run a site called Svelte school. And I'm heavily involved in Svelte society, and help out around the Svelte community.\n\n\nShawn  0:22  \nI'm Shawn, I am still in the process of switching jobs, but hopefully building a Svelte app in production from a next startup. And I mostly should post on Twitter, first of all society. We also did just launched the CFP for the Svelte summit conference that is going to be happening in April, I think, and I'm very excited about organising speakers for that.\n\n\nAntony  0:46  \nI'm Antony I'm the ccfp og which is a booking system for tourism leisure. I'm also a Svelte maintainer, alongside our guest today, who is Simon halt Hauser. And Simon is the I've got it. What can I say is he's the he's the person in charge of language tools. He's He's the code here behind that is absolutely on fire at the moment. I would probably say it's one of the most active sort of segments of the spell organisation. So all credit to him. And the community, of course. So Simon, I'll let you continue with your introduction.\n\n\nSimon Holthausen  1:22  \nYeah, thank you for the warm words. I'm some. I work as a software engineer at a company called xo do software development and consulting. And yeah, I, I don't know more by accident than anything. I stumbled into the spelter world got really hyped. helped out getting the language tools, VS code extension forward and yeah. Now I'm a Svelte maintainer, like Antony. And yeah, really? Thanks for having me.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  1:57  \nYeah, exciting. So you're you're also known on the Svelte discord as Doom Doom, right?\n\n\nSimon Holthausen  2:03  \nYeah, right. It's my handle. Yeah.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  2:05  \nYeah. Where does that come from?\n\n\nSimon Holthausen  2:09  \nYeah, so my, my my original nickname back in the days when I was in puberty, was Hitman Faker. I thought that was a very cool name at that time. And after puberty was over, I thought, No, that's, that doesn't work where email? So I thought, Okay, I need a new nickname. And I was humming along like them to them. What kind of pig? And then I thought, Oh, why why not take this? This? Dum dee dum? Yeah. And so it was just like, it's called loudly fire in German. So.\n\n\nAntony  2:49  \nWow. That was loud.\n\n\nSimon Holthausen  2:53  \nLouder. The word for writing something down? That sounds exactly like you.\n\n\nShawn  3:02  \nAutomatic. Yeah.\n\n\nAntony  3:06  \nYeah. I was gonna say it's more like Him. There's another word for isn't there. When a word sounds like the thing that it describes, is that Onomatopoeia?\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  3:19  \nThis is above my paygrade podcast. Alright, so so TypeScript, what's are sorry, language tools? What's going on there?\n\n\nSimon Holthausen  3:30  \nTypeScript is a big part of language tools. That's definitely right. So yeah, I was, I was here on the on the show about, I don't know, almost a year ago. And I skimmed through some of the issues that we close since then, or we got since then. And yeah, so what changed between then and now. So it's, overall, we just worked hard to get rid of all the edge cases that people might occur when they just coding. And I think, especially all these edge cases, when you when you're in the zone, and you're coding, and then your intelligence does something stupid, that can really put you off, and we are trying really hard to minimise that. new things are about. We also added a lot of new things like we now have auto completion for events. So if you define event by create Event Dispatcher from another component, you get auto compl..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio. Today we have another guest for you all, but first introductions. I'm Kevin, I run Svelte radio and Svelte school, and I'm involved in the Svelte community in general.\n\n\nShawn  0:18  \nI'm Shawn, same here, I guess. I don't read anything. But I guess I've been working on recently the Svelte actions package, trying to have a good set of defaults for Svelte to export. So it inspires people to use actions more. That's me.\n\n\nAntony  0:34  \nI'm Anthony. I'm a CTO of biank also stopped maintainer along with our guests today, which is Ben McCann, who is also Svelte maintainer, a very, very recent one, in fact, not not recently. It's been a while now. So Ben has come in on the back of a huge amount of prs. And he produces them so fast. And he's really pushed the development of stealth itself, but also sapper significantly forward. And yeah, what else? What else is this? There's a lot to Ben. He's extremely polite, nice. And I really, really like that. It's quite refreshing to find the person. And oh, I have to Ben.\n\n\nBen McCann  1:13  \nYeah. It's great to be here with you all today. Thanks for for having me on the show. So how I get so much done, I don't have a day job right now. So that gives me a little more time. I started a start up a few years ago. And so I'm an entrepreneur, and I'm in between companies right now trying to figure out my next one. And, you know, I picked up Svelte to kind of refresh my tech skills and our startup, we were using Angular and don't want to do that again. So it's trying to figure out what's new in the landscape, and hadn't been coding for a number of years as a more of a management role. So I just want to kind of get caught up on two things, and really enjoyed been using Svelte these past few months,\n\n\nShawn  2:02  \nI was just just curious how you first heard about it, because you know, it might someone in your position, you might just go for react as sort of the the most popular framework of the day.\n\n\nBen McCann  2:13  \nYeah. So I mean, one of the ideas that I was experimenting with was for a content based site where I thought that this speed was going to be really important, and performance was going to be really important. And so I really liked that with Svelte, you didn't have to download a runtime, like you do with react. And so, you know, the initial page loads were a lot faster. So that's kind of how I got involved. And then, you know, with snapper, there were a lot of other really nice performance improvements. And those were some of the the first things I started working on when I got involved in sapper. So, you know, one of the things that we did was we added preload headers. So when you first visit a page will fetch all the assets that you need for that page. So instead of having to wait for if one script depends on another script, instead of having to wait for the first script to run and fetch that second script, the page will automatically fetch both of those at the beginning. And so we we kind of crawl your dependency tree and make sure that those are all fetched at the beginning. And then, you know, it's also got CSS code splitting, which is something that, you know, had a few bugs in the past recent releases getting that all worked out. But I think that's really gotten to a very nice place now, where we have, you know, it's always had JavaScript code splitting. And now the CSS is really, I think, a lot easier to manage as well. And so with all that code splitting, you know, it's a really nice performance benefit of using sapper.\n\n\nAntony  4:00  \nSo what the one thing I want to ask him, as I mentioned, the intro, intro that you you were intrapreneur. But also, I believe, and I could be wrong here. But I think you're also a VC of sorts. Is that right?\n\n\nBen McCann  4:10  \nYeah, I've been doing a bunch of investing as an angel investor. And so I've invested in probably about two dozen companies at this point.\n\n\nAntony  4:20  \nWow. Very cool.\n\n\nBen McCann  4:22  \nAs far as I know, none of them use Svelte but I'll spread.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  4:27  \nI gotta push, you gotta push fo..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio first one of the year. Not a lot happened over the holidays. But we're going to go through the new stuff anyway. But first, some introductions. I'm Kevin, I run a site called Svelte School, where I teach people about Svelte and I'm involved in the community side of Svelte as well. Yeah,\n\n\nShawn  0:22  \nI'm Shawn, I work at AWS on AWS amplify, and we are we actually unfixed unbroke, the salt society website recently, so I'm proud of that, even though I didn't really do much there. So shout out to the silentworks, who actually figured out the Modify issue that we had.\n\n\nAntony  0:40  \nNice. I'm Anthony. I'm the CTO of a company called Beyonk, which is a travel and tourism stars in the UK. I'm also a Svelte core maintainer.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  0:48  \nCool. So what have you guys been doing over the holidays?\n\n\nShawn  0:52  \nOh, yeah, we so we figured we will start off with like some updates, right. So I think we some of us got ourselves like Christmas presents. Something I realised actually in catching up with my team at AWS is that everyone bought games, like the games industry must be huge right now. Yeah, I mean, this is not that this is not a surprise, but like, really, because there's nothing else to buy. Yeah, you\n\n\nAntony  1:15  \nsay games? Do you mean like board games? Or do you mean like computer games? \n\n\nShawn  1:19  \nMostly? Mostly computer games, butalso board games? I think I think people went for computer games first. And then we realised that we like the digital stimulation or whatever. It's easier to set up computer games.\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  1:33  \nHave you guys seen the like the cyberpunk game? So what cyberpunk looks amazing. Also very buggy. I was actually I,\n\n\nShawn  1:43  \nthe bugs are the fun part, right? Like you could see one of my top posts on Reddit, the past week was showing off like the amazing detail of the shadowing, of cyberpunk. And how like, even when you hold the rifle, the shadows fall on the rifle and you can you can move around. And then a guy kept on walking backwards. And the shadow came from a car that was being suspended in the air. Because the graphics were like screwed up, like, but the shadows are great.\n\n\nAntony  2:12  \nI mean, this is the bit I didn't understand because what makes game appealing, in my mind the games appealing games feel is in its gameplay, and how explorable is and things like that. I don't know much about games. I mean, I'm a Linux user. I don't really have many games like in the store. Maybe maybe tux racer? I don't know. But I guess the point is for me like I love bugs in games, I think they're I think they're brilliant. They make it much more interesting, but I'm not really a gamer. It looks like so put looks amazing. I've seen some live streaming on Twitch it looks incredible to look at. But honestly from from the brief bit that I looked at it for the game looks like GTA, which is fine in my books, because GTA is the o..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio. Today we have another guest on the show. But first introductions. I'm Kevin, and I run a site called Svelte school where I teach people about Svelte. And yeah, that's me. \n\n\nShawn  0:15  \nI'm Shawn. I work as a developer advocate at AWS. And I guess I do stuff on this whole Twitter's \n\n\nAntony  0:24  \nHi, I'm Antony. I'm the CTO of a startup called biank. I'm a supposed Svelte maintainer. And yeah, that's about it really, I'm also going to introduce the guest, because I know everything there is to know about Luke. So our guest is Luke. And Luke is not Australian. That's the first most important thing there. And so Luke Edwards is an Australian Californian, that's very important to know. He's also a co maintainer of Svelte. And he's the creator of polka, which is an express alternative, which is focused around speed. And also modularity, I believe. And he's been recently involved in deploying loads of stuff to CloudFlare work, which is interesting, this whole talk on that you can watch, it's also worth mentioning that Luke owns the most number of open source modules on NPM out of anyone. And that's a fact, really, anything you want to add to that, that's not true.\n\n\nLuke Edwards  1:20  \nAnd that's pretty much it, I do do a lot of stuff in the open source world. And I imagine we'll talk about some of that. But for the most part, just keep my head down and enjoy building things. So that's kind of what that means contract work or salary positions doesn't really matter. I just love to get my get my hands dirty.\n\n\nAntony  1:37  \n So you don't code for money. As a rule, you code for passion. And money is a convenient side, \n\n\nLuke Edwards  1:42  \nI code for interest, I kind of tell I turn away a lot of not a lot. But I turn away clients with that sometimes, just because if I if I'm not interested in it, then it's not gonna turn out well, and I'm gonna find excuses to try to stop doing it. \n\n\nAntony  1:56  \nNice. It's funny, because I saw Twitter so quite recently about actually, what got you into tech. And the amount of people who replied by just showing a little bullet emoji was quite shocking. Actually, I couldn't imagine being it just for the money just wouldn't work for me. \n\n\nShawn  2:11  \nI mean, I'd say I'd say it's partially for the money for me.\n\n\nAntony  2:16  \nFair enough. I mean, it's not you have a passion in it. Right. You have you you enjoy what you do you enjoy advocating as well, and that sort of thing. But just for the money, just, and they enjoy life, right. Enjoy life first. And then yeah, like,\n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  2:29  \n I don't I don't think I could see myself doing something I didn't want to do. Don't want to do \n\n\nAntony  2:35  \nNo, definitely not. \n\n\nLuke Edwards  2:37  \nIt's also kind of amazing, because like, some people would make like hard career changes, right? Where they're like struggling and stuff, and they'll invest the six months, whatever it is, maybe less, and, like, dramatically turn their lives around. So it does start as just money. But like it's so that they can actually do something else and get by better. That's a good point. Maybe people can grow a passion for it when they start doing it. Maybe that's how they got into it. But that's not how they how they were they were maybe \n\n\nKevin Åberg Kultalahti  3:05  \ni think that's that's definitely true. \n\n\nLuke Edwards  3:07  \nI think that's actually kind of at the core how I started to like, I actually was like, enrolled in med school. I hadn't started I was doing all the like, prereqs and stuff. \n\n\nAntony  3:16  \nwow\n\n\nLuke Edwards  3:16  \nI guess, di..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte radio. Today we're going to discuss what's happened in Svelte these last few weeks, maybe months. But first, some introductions. I'm Kevin, I run Svelte school. I'm heavily involved in the Svelte community. And yeah, that's me.\n\n\nShawn  0:20  \nHey, everyone. I'm Shawn. I work at AWS and I mostly should post on Twitter. That's my job.\n\n\nAntony  0:28  \nHey, I'm Anthony. I'm a maintainer of Svelte and I am the CTO of beyond. Nice.\n\n\nKevin  0:35  \nAnd today we're joined by none other than Ah, Hi,\n\n\nKarine  0:39  \nI'm Karine. And I work in Seneca in France and I'm the CO organiser of Svelte society day France.\n\n\nShawn  0:48  \nOh, welcome, welcome. \n\n\nAntony  0:50  \nAnd you have a cool discord name as well. \n\n\nShawn  0:52  \nK6 what is Yeah, what is key six?\n\n\nKarine  0:54  \nOh, it's just because Karine is six letters and K6 is shorter \n\n\nAntony  0:58  \nIt's the thing right is Kubernetes\n\n\nShawn  1:03  \nNumeruneum. There's a term for that \n\n\nAntony  1:05  \nnumeruneum. I see!\n\n\nKevin  1:07  \nI did not know that.\n\n\nShawn  1:09  \nFor those who may not know actually so Corinne basically organise society day you run Svelte society, France, and it was just like a beginning to end. I wasn't sure if like Svelte was ready for like a non English conference. But you just did it. And then you got so many submissions. Even got rich to say some French.\n\n\nKarine  1:31  \nA very memorable moment. That's been recorded. Oh, right.\n\n\nKevin  1:35  \nYou can see that online. Right.\n\n\nKarine  1:37  \nYeah. On the YouTube channel.\n\n\nShawn  1:39  \nYeah, I mean, I think there is a French community. I think Schneider Electric, they get back I was speaking in French. Then there was like the the newspaper like, was it les echos?\n\n\nKarine  1:49  \nYes, Les Echos, Yes. And they do lots of infographics, papers. Some of them are powered with Svelte animation. I think there's also a radio france, which is the well the broadcaster of many different radios. And they they use Svelte in some part, and they have a very, I just tweeted recently, an article by their tech, tech lead, and they have a very interesting and modern stack, including Svelte.\n\n\nAntony  2:23  \nWow. I mean, radio, France has clearly sort of got their inspiration from start radio.\n\n\nKevin  2:30  \nObviously, it's cool. Speaking of Svelte, what's new with the Svelte lately? Anyone know,\n\n\nShawn  2:40  \nthere's some versions.\n\n\nKevin  2:42  \nExciting.\n\n\nAntony  2:44  \nSo we've we've definitely started publishing a newsletter. I don't know exactly who's involved in that. But somebody sort of started publishing announcements, because I think we mentioned on here that we never announced any new features, we just kind of rolled them out. And it's good to sort of get a bit of notice and traction around around the version. So there is no newsletter. I'm terrible, because I don't know where it lives or how to see it.

Welcome to another episode of Svelte Radio. Today we have yet another guest. But before we introduce the guest, we're going to introduce ourselves. So I’m Kevin. I run a site called Svelte School, and I love Svelte, and I run this podcast as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:19] SW: I’m Sean. I work at AWS, and I’ve been doing some work on the Svelte Society website recently. Got to give it some love. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:26] AJ: Hi, I’m Antony. I’m a Svelte maintainer, mostly working on kit at the moment. And I’m also CTO of Beyonk, which is a booking system for tourism and leisure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:35] SW: And thanks for picking back up, hopefully. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:38] AJ: They are. Well, yes. And it’s a tough one, but I think so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:43] KAK: All right. So our guest today is Scott Tolinski. He is a friend of the show, sponsor and lover of Svelte it seems like, because I just listened to you on the latest SyntaxFm where you're the co-host. And when someone asked what's the best and easiest JavaScript framework for beginners, both of you answers Svelte, which is I think it's an interesting change from before maybe where you may not necessarily have said that. And Scott is – So I’m going to try and do an intro, because I feel like I’ve heard it so much, but then also you can fill in the gaps. I like that description that you always say like you're a full stack developer from Denver, Colorado. That's a mouthful, but it accurately describes everything. You run Level Up Tutorials, which actually I think started as a YouTube channel with some tutorials on some kind of design software that I have it in my watch list, but I haven't seen it yet. It's a huge channel. I think you're like 300 something K subscribers. But now it's a paid platform where you have monthly video courses. And then you're also a Bboy, and I always love watching your videos of your breakdancing. Is there anything that is typically not mentioned in intros that you'd like to share?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:55] ST: I don't know. I’ve been a developer for since 2011 professionally, but I’ve just been a lover of making websites for a very long time. I just like really find passion in this stuff. So whether or not that is like a part of my business platform or what I’m doing, like it was first and foremost like a hobby for me and the thing I kept going back to. So maybe that isn't often mentioned just like how much I truly love this stuff, and I think that's maybe something a little interesting or not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:27] KAK: Yeah. I mean I do see when you post updates about how you're changing the Level UP site, and you put some effort into the little details of the animations and stuff like that on the site and it really shows that you pay attention to the details. And it's mostly a one-man operation, right? Like you have some content creators, but it's mostly you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:45] ST: Yeah. And I’ve had three guest creators and we just hired on our first like full-time developer last month. We've had a part-time developer for the past like year or so, a good friend of mine. And then now we have two devs working on it, one who's part-time and one who's full-time. And so it's a growing operation and we're hoping to have a bunch more guest content creators on next year. We have a few people signed on to do some really neat courses for us on stuff that are gaps in my knowledge base. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's funny because like some people are a little surprised that I can produce like a 20 video tutorial series in a month every month for a year. But I should say that I’ve been doing it since 2012. So like for me I have the flow and everything so practiced and I have the formula down to how I like to do things and how I like to learn things and how I like to explore topics that like, “Hey, when we started Level Up Tutorials, it was just a way to try to give back to the Drupal community specifically on YouTube because there was like no good Drupal content.” I was cranking three videos every Monday and Wednesday. So I was getting like six to nine videos a week. And I just did that for a billion years until now, and then it's like I’ve ..."

I'm your host, Kevin, I run Svelte school. And today we have a very special episode, we have the creator of a Svelte, Rich Harris. But before he gets to introduce himself, we'll kick it off with our other hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:19] S: Hey, I’m Sean, work at AWS on random stuff, including trying to get Svelte into AWS and that is an ongoing mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:30] A: Hi, I'm Anthony, and I'm the CTO of Biank. And also Svelte maintainer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:35] RH: And I'm a graphics editor at the New York Times currently working on SvelteKit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:42] KA: Whoo, cool. The new shiny thing before we get started, how are you? How's everything with the election and all of this stuff? How's the workload? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:50] RH: For me, thankfully, it's settling down. Last week was quite a busy week for everyone. Certainly in the graphics department at the times and probably in the organization as a whole. It's very difficult to avoid getting sucked into the madness. But you know, what is fun? There's no better place to witness history than from a newsroom, even if it is a virtual newsroom scattered around people's homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:10] KA: Something I didn't didn't appreciate about your election coverage is that you're actually spinning up visualizations fairly quickly based on what counties or states are in focus at the time. Like, there's some parts of this that you could not have prepared beforehand, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:26] RH: Yeah, there's some sleight of hand, you know, you prepare for a variety of different outcomes. But yeah, like, as soon as the results start coming in, the politics editors, and the graphics editors who are covering this, are bashing their heads together and trying to figure out what is the story. And then that kind of filters down to the people making the charts and maps. And we all come together, we analyze data, and we try and figure out what just happened. There is some infrastructure that's already built out, because you kind of know that people are gonna want to know which parts of the country swaying in one direction. But yes, a lot of it is kind of rapid response, data visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:05] KA: So you've got Lego blocks for building visualizations that will tell you population, this area voted this way or whatever, you've got that sort of stuff?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:14] RH: Yeah, like you know that you're going to need a lot of demographic information about counties, like we know that the results are going to be coming in per county or in New England it’s per township, because they like to do things differently. And you just have all of the data that you might possibly need in a massive spreadsheet at a time. And then you can also plug it in to make something relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:37] KA: Alright, so we're not here for the election. We're here for something that's more exciting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:48] RH: That’s certainly, perspective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:51] KA: For sure. So we're going to talk about SvelteKit today. So before we dive in to the questions, what is SvelteKit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:59] RH: SvelteKit is, in one way it's a successor to Sapper. And you could even think of it as Sapper 1.0, if you like. But in another larger sense, it's our kind of vision for the way that you should build Svelte apps in future. It’s something that we've been kind of talking about in a peripheral sense for a long time, we've been talking about how we can evolve Sapper to take advantage of some of the recent trends in front end development, particularly the rise of serverless. And more recently, the rise of unbundled workflows, which I'm sure we'll get into later. But it all sort of came to a head recently, you know, the pace of development on Sapper had hit a bit of a low, at least until Ben McCann really picked up the baton and started churning through issues. And people were getting a little bit frustrated, I think with the progress. And Anthony is one of those people because he uses Sapper very heavily in his job. At a certain point, we're like, “What if we just started from scratch?” Like the big rewrite, as opposed to trying to get all of these ideas into what was honestly kind of a watery codebase. I sort of proposed this very hes..."

Welcome to another episode of Svelte Radio. I’m your host, Kevin. And I ran a site called Svelte School and I’m joined by my two co-host, Antony and Shawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:11] AJ: I’m Antony, the CTO of Beyonk. I’m a Svelte maintainer. And actually, I can say this now, I’m currently working on Sveltekit, which is quite fun,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:18] SW: Oh, that’s hot. We should talk about that. I’m Shawn. I work at AWS and temporal. I don’t really kind of work on anything, but I do use other GS a lot, so that’s fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:30] KA: All right. Last weekend -- it was last weekend, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:35] SW: October 18th, I had the date memorized because I was so promoting it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:41] KA: I have no idea. Time is not my --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:45] SW: Ground circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:46] AJ: Yeah, I know. Not mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:47] KA: All right. What did you guys think? Was it good.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:50] SW: Yeah. I think we went very well. I wasn’t sure if I was going to stick through the whole event, but it was going to be a long one and it was very late at night and on a weekend. But then, I just found the conversation really entertaining, the talks are cool and I stuck around for the entire thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:06] KA: Well, that’s awesome, seven hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:08] AJ: Yeah. I mean, I also did stick around for the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:12] SW: You cycled like a billion miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:15] AJ: Actually, it’s quite a short cycle, because I was trying to moderate the chat from my phone while sitting on the bike, watching the conference. But also, I had like the cycle trainer up and everything else. Yeah, it was interesting, trying to do too many things at one space. I think I did like 20, 25k or something, which is not impressive but it’s worth doing. It was a good feeling as well. What I found was it’s surprisingly easy to concentrate when you’re a cycle trainer watching a conference. I think that I’d like to just go to more events like that, but while cycling because it works really well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:54] KA: I like working out as well while like watching stuff because it’s nice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:58] AJ: But it’s quite hard, right? I’ve tried running and watching The Simpsons and I can’t do that. It’s just impossible, but this was much easier for some reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:06] KA: Cycling is probably a bit easier, kind of in my mind at least feels like it would be easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:12] AJ: Yeah. Well, you’re sitting down for one thing, but also, I guess you can vary the cadence quite easily. Like you can just change gear and make it easier or harder if you want to focus on a specific bed. It’s not like you’re having to maintain it constant all the time. Yeah, it works really well, works really well, so I’ll try to do that in the future actually. Then yeah, watching the rest on the TV downstairs, and it was me watching it and enjoying it, and my wife having enforced upon her. That’s, you know, hey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:41] KA: Which talks did you guys like the most? I think my favorite was like The Web à la Mode one, for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:47] AJ: Oh, yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:47] KA: Like in a creative way, I really like that one. The flying head and --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:52] AJ: Yeah. I think that’s an easy one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:55] SW: I mean, he actually I think expanded. I personally do a lot of pre-recorded classroom speaking. He’s a first-time speaker and he expanded my idea of what a pre-recorded talking do. It’s like he built that thing, and then played music. Then the rest of the talk was, had that back in music. Now, it’s just genius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:17] AJ: Yeah. It’s nice to have a pay setter like music wise. I don’t know if you have heard of the comedian, Mitch Hedberg. He’s death now, but he always had this like weird beat going onto like his entire set. It elevates it. It adds like a massive dimension to it, and I’m not really sure why. I can’t remember what the beat is. It’s like — I think it’s somebody playing an instrument called Chuck. When his jokes changed and when his jokes starts to fail, or whatever, which he do a lot because he’s kind of an abstract comedian. He will just say, “Can you just sort of ramp it up a bit, Chuck” and Chuck sort of increase this tempo a bit and change up the way it sounds.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:56] KA: That’s such a good idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:57] AJ: It’s really good.

Welcome to another episode of Svelte Radio. We have a special episode today about the upcoming event, Svelte Summit. But before we begin, we are going to introduce ourselves. So I’m Kevin. I run Svelte School. Then we have Shawn and Antony. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:19] SW: I’m Shawn. I work at AWS and I recently rewrote my blog in Elder.js. It’s fully done now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:27] A: Hi. I’m Antony. I’m the CTO of Beyonk and I’m also a Svelte maintainer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:33] KA: All right, cool. Svelte Summit, are you guys excited?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:37] AJ: A part. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:37] SW: Very. I’m very excited. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:39] KA: Awesome. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:40] SW: Awesome. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:40] KA: I am as well. We have so many great talks lined up. And compared to the Svelte Society data we had a couple months ago or half a year ago, it was a long time ago. We only got like 12 proposals. But this time we got around 40, so we’re growing. That’s great. I guess we can talk a bit about some of the talks. Let's start with the –\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:06] SW: Yeah. I guess I also wanted to like reflect a little bit on like the journey that we took to get here. Like all three of us, we started Svelte meet ups in the cities that we lived in a year ago. Actually, the first time I came about the name Svelte Society was like at the very first meet up in New York where just kind of like introducing it to people. Then I said like in one year we could have like a – It was like a very tentative question mark, but I knew that the name was right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:37] KA: It does work well, yeah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:40] SW: So maybe we could’ve bought the domain back then, but I think it all worked out. I didn’t have confidence or faith that I could do it, so definitely like a lot of credit goes to Kev for being the lead organizer for all this. This is amazing that you actually got all these people together and organized all this, so massive kudos to Kev. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:00] AJ: Absolutely, yeah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:01] KA: Thanks. Thank you. It is actually quite a lot of work when you think about it, or rather it's like comes and goes, like the workload. So at times, you have a lot to do and then – For example, this week I’m going to have a lot to do because I have to edit all the talks together into one big talk, and you have to like do the website and all of the stuff. But for next time, we’re probably just going to reuse the website or a variation of it at least. I think it works well. It looks good. Wolfer did a great job on the design as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:38] SW: Yeah, and community conferences are definitely driven by volunteers, and I imagine every framework, every programming language runs into this when they’re just getting off the ground. And it takes people like you, people like us, to just volunteer and not wait for some other person to do it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:56] KA: Yeah. It’s very easy to just wait for something to happen. But if everyone does that, it’s never going to happen, right? So it’s a lot of fun as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:07] SW: That's one thing I noticed, like being involved in the community opens a lot of doors. You get to meet a lot of people, talk to a lot of people that you probably otherwise wouldn't have talked to, so that’s also fun. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:18] KA: Yeah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:19] AJ: I also think it’s quite –\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:20] KA: Even the guests that we’ve had on even on this podcast has been pretty good actually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:25] AJ: Yeah. No, I think it’s quite new. It’s something to organize and meet up in your town kind of thing. It was difficult for me because it’s not something I’ve really done or thought I could do before. But I think that taking that to a sort of global scale is a lot more difficult, and it’s something that I probably still don’t think I could do. So, yeah, like Shawn says, well done, Kev. I think that’s something that you really sort of pushed the bar there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:48] KA: I think it’s funny because in some ways I think it’s easier, and then others it’s harder for some reason. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:53] AJ: Yeah. It’s the others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:55] SW: I was about to say that because when I was – I think we organized like maybe five or six Svelte Society in New York before everything shut down, and I was responsible for booking the venue, like getting everyone in the door. Sometimes, the instructions to get in the building were bad, and then people would be calling me and emailing me. Then at the same ti..."

Welcome to another Svelte Radio Podcast. Today, we have another guest with us. Before we get to that, let’s do introductions. I’m Kevin. I run Svelte School and I’m heavily involved in the Svelte Society community stuff for Svelte. Yeah, that's me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:18] SW: I’m Shawn I work at AWS on developer experience. Most recently, I’ve also been working on finally shipping my own site in Elderjs, which is the new Svelte static site generator. It's very fast, because it basically ships almost nothing. Yeah, I really like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:38] AJ: Hi. I’m Antony. I’m a CTO at Beyonk, which is a platform for experienced booking. I’m also a Svelte core maintainer. I’m involve with Svelte Radio, Svelte green tea, apparently a lot of stuff that I don't know how I got involved in, but there you go. Yeah, thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:55] KAK: All right. The guest for today is Mark. Mark Volkmann, is that how you say it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:01] MV: That's correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:02] KAK: Yeah. What's your deal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:05] MV: Yeah. I’m a software consultant in the St. Louis area in Missouri. I work at object computing. We provide training and consulting and all kinds of software development. These days I mostly focus on web development, but I really work in the full stack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:22] KAK: Awesome. You've written a book on Svelte, right? It's probably why you’re here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:26] MV: That’s right. Exactly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:29] KAK: How was that experience?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:31] MV: It was quite challenging. I have a long history of writing. I write a lot of articles for my company that get published on our website and sent out to subscribers to those articles. I’ve been speaking at conferences and user groups for a long time and teaching classes. I had a long history of writing. This is the first time my writing has been examined this closely by a large number of reviewers. It was quite an experience trying to deal with all the feedback that I was getting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:01] KAK: Nice. Why Svelte?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:03] MV: For me, it's all about developer experience. There's so many reasons to choose Svelte, but I really focus heavily on at least my own productivity. I find that I’m just way more productive in Svelte. A lot of that has to do with the features that are built in that make things so simple and result in you writing less code to get things done. For me, some of the top features are the way that you deal with state inside a component and the way that you share state across component using stores. Both of those are just so much simpler than what I see in any of the other web frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:41] AJ: Yeah. I like this part that actually – I liked it so much that I took a screenshot of it. In chapter five, you have this table on component communication options and you've got props, slots, events, context, module context and stores and I think that's a really good recap of how these things go. I don't know. I never had it put so clearly to me. but I do have a special preference for stores. They were the first Svelte talk that I did at the New York City Svelte Society meetup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:08] MV: Right. When you compare it to what you have in other frameworks, like Redux and React, or Vuex and Vue, or NGRX and Angular, it's just a night and day difference in the complexity level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:19] KAK: Yeah. Your book is pretty comprehensive. I’ve skimmed through it, read parts of it. It seems like the tutorial, but on steroids. It covers pretty much everything. It feels like a good next step after doing the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:37] MV: Yeah, I think that's right. I would recommend that people go through the tutorial, because that's excellent. I did really aim to sh..."

I work on, I guess, on a bunch of things, but currently I’m a senior developer advocate at AWS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:24] AJ: Hey, everyone. I’m Anthony. Yeah, I also work in a bunch of things, but I can only run my own startup called Beyonk, which I’m the CTO. And I’m also a Svelte maintainer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:34] KA: Awesome. So, today we have an awesome guest on the show. Can you introduce yourself? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:40] HD: Yeah, absolutely. My name is Houssein. I am a web developer advocate on Google, on the Google team. So I work with Chrome, but I also work in the focused web as a whole.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:50] SW: That’s awesome. It’s kind of my idea to bring in Houssein on the podcast, because I thought he’d be a good guest. Houssein has basically dabbled in every framework ever. I didn’t know you started out in Angular actually, but I dug through your blog and I was like, “This guy did Angular?” I first met you at Boston, React Boston, where you gave a really good talk that turned into this kind of semi-viral blog post on React performance. And now you’re dabbling in Svelte, and then between you and your twin. You cover all the frameworks. I think that’s a strategy somewhere. So, yeah. I mean, I figured you’d be a really good guest, because you have a cross-framework perspective that most people don’t. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:30] HD: Yeah. No. Thanks for having me. And I’m glad you mentioned that, because I like I’ve never actually properly used Vue, but my twin brother hasn’t. He’s been really involved in that space [inaudible 00:01:39].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:41] KA: So you started out with Angular. So, can you like talk us through the history of like the frameworks you’ve used? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:48] HD: Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely.  I only gone into web development about 4, 5-ish years ago. And that happened right after I graduated from university. I was in my first job and I was just trying to get my footing and like my first sort of role. And then I sort of joined the web development, and we were building a pretty large insurance platform. And we were using AngularJS. And this was pre-component AngularJS. So we’re talking model view controllers. We’re talking root scope, and bindings, and dependency injection, and services. So that was kind of my first hurrah into the frameworks world, which is interesting, because I think we see a lot of discussion on Twitter and the like about how a lot of people think it’s better to just first understand JavaScript, the basics of JavaScript before you jump in to a framework. There’re a lot of other people who think it doesn’t really matter. Learning is learning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that for me was a forcing function for me to just learn JavaScript, because I had no idea what was going on in the beginning. So I felt really lost for at least a few months. Funny story, it was me and my twin brother at the same job sitting side-by-side working on the project for a year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:02] KA: I can really relate to getting forced to learn JavaScript by doing frameworks.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:08] HD: Right? Exaxctly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:08] KA: Same thing for me. Yeah.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03:09] HD: Right? Exactly. But I think after a few months, I started..."

But first, let’s get into introductions. I’m Kevin. I run a site called Svelte School, where I teach you all about Svelte and what to do and what not to do in Svelte. Soon, we are going to have our first video course. Keep looking. Yeah, that's me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:26] SW: Exciting. I’m Shawn. Hi. I’m also known as Swyx. I work at AWS as a developer advocate. What have I done with Svelte recently? I played around with Elder.js and I’m working on moving my own site over to Elder.js as a static site generator built in Svelte.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:42] AJ: Hi.

For those who don't know where Malaysia is, it's a Southeast Asia country right between Thailand and Singapore. That's where I’m from. It has better food, no offense, than Singapore.

It's very funny. I promise you. You can search for Shopee Ronaldo and we get him to do a baby shark dance with Shopee. That's hilarious. You have to check it out. I think a lot of people who are not in this region would think that Shopee and Shopify is related, but we are not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:30] SW: I had a friend from Malaysia when I was young.

Welcome to another Svelte Radio Podcast. This week, we don’t have a guest. But as usual, the three of us are here. So, I’m Kevin. I run a site called Svelte School, where you can find tutorials and the training material to learn Svelte. And I’m joined by my two other cohosts, Shawn and Anthony. Do you want to go ahead and present yourselves? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:28] SW: Hey, everyone. This is Shawn. I guess I have to do some self intro. I work at AWS as a senior developer advocate, and happy to be here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:38] AJ: I’m Anthony, and I the CTO of Beyonk, which is a booking platform, book software for experiences and travel. And I am also a Svelte maintainer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:49] KA: Amazing. So since last time, what have you guys been up to? Have you done anything interesting? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:00:57] SW: Well, I can go while you guys think of your updates. I can only think about the things that I’ve been doing recently, which is not doing Svelte. So kind of the biggest community React Conference is called React Rally, and it’s happening tomorrow. And I spent the last two weeks essentially – Well, this is Svelte related. I’ve created Svelte for React. Basically, the way that you do immutability and sort of assignment in Svelte, you can actually just point that over to React. I did that. And then I made a whole talk around it with the whole idea of like why you should be experimenting with different formats and stuff like that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing any talk is big, but I think this conference is special to me because that’s how I first stated. That’s my first ever conference in 2018. That’s the first talk I ever gave. And I owe a lot to that conference. So I wanted to do a good job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:01:54] AJ: Yeah. From my point, it has been 38+ degrees here in the UK and it’s very hard to work and very hard to think in that kind of heat. And specially we don’t have air con in our houses and stuff like that. So it’s just a matter of – I don’t even know. There’s no way to stay cool. But meanwhile, I’ve been obviously working hard in my startup, which is Beyonk. And then we’ve been doing a fair bit of Svelte work. So mostly that and making contribution a bit easier. Getting some PRs closed and that sort of thing. Yeah, all kind of very software-related and the crazy heat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:02:39] KA: Okay. So I’ve been working these last few weeks on the new Svelte Society Day website as well as the upcoming conference that we’re going to talk about in a bit. Spoiler alert. Then today we are also going to talk about some other stuff. There’s new static side generator. Routify just released their 2.0 release, and a couple of other random things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get started. First off, Svelte Society Day France. I heard they had like a lot of proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00:03..."
